# Live Draft Tool - Implementation Plan

## Overview
Convert Excel-based live draft utility to Streamlit app with real-time value calculations and pick tracking.

## Core Requirements

### Draft Configuration
- [ ] Set number of teams (8, 10, 12, 14, 16, etc.)
- [ ] Set number of rounds (typically 15-17 for fantasy)
- [ ] Choose draft type: Snake vs Straight
- [ ] Name/save draft configurations

### Live Draft Interface
- [ ] Visual draft board showing all picks by round/team
- [ ] Easy player search and assignment to picks
- [ ] Real-time pick tracking
- [ ] Undo/edit previous picks

### Recommendation Engine
- [ ] Value calculation formula (user's proprietary model)
- [ ] Real-time recalculation after each pick
- [ ] Display top recommended players for active drafter
- [ ] Consider positional needs, scarcity, value over replacement

### Data Integration
- [ ] Use projections data for player values
- [ ] Use ADP data for market value/reach analysis
- [ ] Combine both for comprehensive player valuation

## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Draft configurations
CREATE TABLE draft_configs (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    num_teams INTEGER,
    num_rounds INTEGER,
    draft_type TEXT, -- 'snake' or 'straight'
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Individual draft sessions
CREATE TABLE draft_sessions (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    config_id INTEGER,
    current_pick INTEGER,
    status TEXT, -- 'active', 'completed', 'paused'
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Draft picks tracking
CREATE TABLE draft_picks (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    session_id INTEGER,
    pick_number INTEGER,
    round_number INTEGER,
    team_number INTEGER,
    player_name TEXT,
    player_team TEXT,
    position TEXT,
    picked_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Streamlit App Structure
```
üìÅ pages/
  üìÑ 01_projections.py (existing tables)
  üìÑ 02_draft_tool.py (new live draft interface)
  
üìÅ components/
  üìÑ draft_board.py (visual draft grid)
  üìÑ player_search.py (searchable player list)
  üìÑ value_calculator.py (recommendation engine)
  
üìÅ utils/
  üìÑ draft_logic.py (snake/straight draft order)
  üìÑ value_formulas.py (user's recommendation model)
```

## Key Features to Implement

### 1. Draft Setup Page
- Form to configure new draft
- Load existing draft configurations
- Validation for reasonable team/round counts

### 2. Live Draft Board
- Grid layout: Rounds (rows) x Teams (columns)
- Color coding for different positions
- Click-to-assign player functionality
- Real-time updates

### 3. Player Search & Assignment
- Searchable/filterable player list
- Show projections + ADP data
- Quick assign to current pick
- Remove/reassign players

### 4. Recommendation Engine
- Calculate player values after each pick
- Consider remaining roster needs
- Factor in positional scarcity
- Display top 5-10 recommendations

### 5. Draft Analytics
- Team roster summaries
- Positional analysis
- Value tracking (steals/reaches)
- Export draft results

## Questions for User

1. **Value Formula**: What specific factors does your recommendation formula consider?
   - Projected points vs ADP?
   - Positional scarcity?
   - Roster construction needs?
   - Other proprietary factors?

2. **Draft Flow**: 
   - Do you want to track all teams' picks or just focus on your team?
   - Should the tool auto-advance to next pick or manual control?

3. **Player Data**:
   - Any additional player attributes needed (injury status, etc.)?
   - Should we pull in additional data sources?

4. **Interface Preferences**:
   - Preferred layout for the draft board?
   - Most important info to display for each player?

5. **Export/Save**:
   - What format for exporting draft results?
   - Need to save/resume draft sessions?

## Implementation Priority
1. Basic draft configuration and setup
2. Draft board visualization
3. Player search and assignment
4. Snake draft logic
5. Recommendation engine integration
6. Advanced analytics and export
